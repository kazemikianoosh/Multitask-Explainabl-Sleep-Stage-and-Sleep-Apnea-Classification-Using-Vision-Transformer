# Multitask-Explainabl-Sleep-Stage-and-Sleep-Apnea-Classification-Using-Vision-Transformer
In this repository, we propose a 1D-Vision Transformer for simultaneous classification of sleep stages and sleep disorders. Our method exploits the sleep disordersâ€™ correlation with specific sleep stage patterns and performs a simultaneous identification of a sleep stage and sleep disorder.
